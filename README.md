# Overview

This is the project home for ZK's data-attribute-handler contest. Once the candidate projects from all participants have being reviewed, they will be pushed into this repository. 

Official Contest Page: 

# The Procedure

Please refer to the chartist sample under `src/main/webapp/chartist` to build your own. 

Detailed Steps: 

1. Fork this repository
2. Create your own folder under `webapp`, naming convention follows Java variable naming convention, e..g `appName`.
If you encounter a naming conflict, add your name as a prefix like `authorNameAppName`.
3. Put all your required resources (js, css) under your own folder) to avoid affecting other participants'.
4. Complete your handlers. Java package name convention is `org.zkoss.handlers.authorname.appname`.
5. Create an `index.zul` under your folder to demonstrate your handler. Include your name and information on the 3rd party library on the index page as demonstrated in the chartist sample project.
6. Create at least one screenshot for your application under `appName/screenshot/`. You can also submit a short video.
7. Cend a pull request of your result to us, and at the same time submit your application form at (link to google form)
8. If you have successfully integrated a 3rd party library with ZK 8's data-handler and followed all the instructions to provide sufficient details and did not violate any rules, we will accept your pull request. Yours will then become one of the qualified candidate projects.

# Notice
1. Never modify other contestants' files or configurations.
