# Overview

This is the project home for ZK's data attribute handler contest and the candidate projects from all participants, once being reviewed will be pushed into this repository. 
Official contest page: 

# The Procedure

Please reference the chartist sample under `src/main/webapp/chartist` to build your owned one. 
Detailed steps,

1. fork this repository
2. create your owned folder under `webapp`, naming convention follows Java variable naming convention, e..g `appName`.
If you encounter a naming conflict, add your name as a prefix like `authorNameAppName`.
3. put all your required resources (js, css) under your owned folder) to avoid affecting other participants'.
4. complete your handlers. Java package name convention is `org.zkoss.handlers.authorname.appname`.
5. create an `index.zul` under your folder to demonstrate your handler. Include your name and information on the 3rd party library on the index page as in the chartist sample project.
6. create at least one screenshot for your application under `appName/screenshot/`. You can also submit a video.
7. send a pull request of your result to us, and at the same time submit your application form at (link to google form)
8. If you provide sufficient data and don't violate any rules, we will accept your pull request.

# Notice
1. Never modify other constestants' files or configurations.
